# Code of Conduct

Hey there, it's Thomas! I'm really keen on keeping this project fun and inclusive. Everyone's welcome, no matter who you are or where you come from.

## Let's Have Fun

* Be kind and empathetic.
* Respect other's opinions and viewpoints.
* Learn from your mistakes, and most importantly, from each other.
* Focus on what's best for everyone.

## Not Fun

* No inappropriate language or imagery.
* No personal attacks or offensive behavior.
* No harassment, public or private.
* No publishing others' private info without permission.

## If Things Are Not Fun

If you see or experience something that's not fun, drop me an email at thomascountz@gmail.com. I'll take it seriously, and handle it respectfully and fairly.

Depending on what happened, I might send a warning, or for repeated or serious incidents, issue a temporary or even permanent ban from the project.

Let's keep it fun, respectful, and awesome!
